        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>I’m Momina Ishtiaq, a dedicated Software Engineering student at SZABIST in Islamabad, where I maintain the highest CGPA in my class. With a passion for business and data, I recently completed an internship as a Business Data Analyst at MENTOR360 and currently work as a freelance writer. My journey began with a dream to study medicine, but I found my true calling in the world of numbers and storytelling.</p>
        <p>As a Contributor and Community Builder Intern at PRWords.com, I connect with executives to enhance their personal and brand marketing strategies. In my free time, I enjoy reading, hiking, and caring for my cat. I aspire to start my own business while navigating my career choices for the future.</p>
